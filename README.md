## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

## üõ† Manual Setup (Local Development)

**1. Start PostgreSQL**
Make sure you have PostgreSQL running locally. Create a database (e.g., bookinline) and configure your credentials in application-dev.properties:
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bookinline
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```
**2. Start Redis**
Run Redis locally (default port 6379). You can install it via:
```
# On macOS (Homebrew)
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# On Linux
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo service redis-server start
```
Configure Redis in application.properties if necessary:
```
spring.cache.type=redis
spring.redis.host=localhost
spring.redis.port=6379
```
**3. Run the App**
Use Maven to build and run the application:
```
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
**Swagger UI** will be available at:
`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`

## üê≥ Docker-based Setup

The project includes a Docker configuration for local development. <br />
**1. Build the Docker Image** <br />

`docker-compose build` <br />

**2. Run with Docker Compose** <br /> 

The docker-compose.yml file contains services for the app, PostgreSQL, and Redis: <br />

`docker-compose -d up` <br />

This will:
 - Start the backend service
 - Launch Redis and PostgreSQL containers
 - Set up environment automatically using pre-configured values

‚úÖ No need to modify application.properties for Docker ‚Äî configs are injected via environment variables or mounted files.
