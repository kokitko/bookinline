## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

The project uses environment variables for configuration (for PostgreSQL, Redis, and Amazon S3).  
A `.env.example` file is provided in the project root ‚Äî **copy it to `.env` and fill in the required values** before running the application.

- If you use Docker, environment variables are injected automatically using the `.env` file and Docker Compose.
- For manual (local) execution, you'll need to either:
    - create a `.env` file in the root folder and use an env plugin (e.g., `envfile` for IntelliJ, or `direnv`), or
    - export the variables in your shell session before running the app.

**Note:**  
- Use the `*_DEV` variables when running locally with Maven.  
- Use the `*_PROD` variables when running via Docker Compose.

---

### üõ† Manual Setup (Local Development)

**1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out your local (DEV) values.**

**2. Start PostgreSQL**  
Make sure you have PostgreSQL running locally. Create a database (e.g., bookinline) and set your credentials via environment variables.

**3. Start Redis**  
Run Redis locally (default port 6379).  
- macOS: `brew install redis && brew services start redis`
- Linux: `sudo apt install redis-server && sudo service redis-server start`

**4. Run the App**  
Use Maven to build and run the application:
```
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
**Swagger UI** will be available at:  
`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`

---

### üê≥ Docker-based Setup

**1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out your production (PROD) values.**

**2. Build the Docker Image**  
```
docker-compose build
```

**3. Run with Docker Compose**  
```
docker-compose up -d
```
This will:
 - Start the backend service
 - Launch Redis and PostgreSQL containers
 - Configure all environment variables automatically (using `.env`)

‚úÖ **No need to modify application.properties for Docker ‚Äî configs are injected via environment variables or mounted files.**

### üìö Swagger API Docs

Swagger UI is enabled and available at:  
`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`  
It provides complete documentation for all endpoints, including security schemes, schemas, and example payloads.

---

### ‚úÖ Future Improvements / TODOs

1. Host analytics dashboard.
2. Notifications (email/SMS).
3. Email verification on registration.
